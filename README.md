# ML2 Project Guidelines

TODOS:
- find dataset (between 500 and 2000 observations, at least 5 predictor variables and an outcome variable -> supervised)
- compare 2 ML methods (at least 1 method must be from the ML2 course) in R

### Dataset choice:

data source
- https://www.cdc.gov/healthyyouth/data/yrbs/data.htm

### Target variable

categorical (classification problem)
-> risk of suicide score aggregated among q25-q29 variables (questions related to suicide) of the dataset

### Classification methods used:
- 1st model from ML2 course: naive bayes 
- 2nd model from ML2 course: SVM 

### Report: as pdf

**deadline: 9th of january**
 project report will include:
 
- a short description of your data,
- a short mathematical overview of the two ML methods used,
- a description of your fitting process including, a summary of how you arrived at your final model, the choice of hyperparameters and how you made this choice,
- an appropriate assessment of the predicted values and a fair comparison of the two methods using the test data.
- appropriate graphical presentation.
- a bibliography of sources used, referenced in the main text.

## submission
 to submit your work, you should upload in Moodle:
- your report in a standard format (such as PDF format),
- your data set and
- your R code in a script file. The R script should include code to read in the data, indicate the main parts using comments and run without errors.
