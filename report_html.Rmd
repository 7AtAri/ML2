# Introduction (example)

For our data visualization project, we searched for a dataset that 
holds tabular data and images. The idea was to use image data to visualize the latent space of a neural network but also investigate relationships in tabular data and connect or compare the findings. We were happy to find a dataset that fit our wishes on Kaggle and originally was used for the *[PetFinder.my](https://www.petfinder.my) Adoption Prediction* challenge. "PetFinder.my has been Malaysia's leading animal welfare platform since 2008, with a database of more than 150,000 animals"[[1]](#1).

```{r categorical variables frequencies, fig.width=10, fig.height=8}



# this can be used to includ pictures in the main text: ![](plots/tsne-2000.png)
```



The necessary code for the background gradient was adapted from Stack Overflow [[3]](#3).


```{r rtsne 3d clear, echo=FALSE}
# exemplary inclusion of an html file
# htmltools::includeHTML("tsne_plot_hover-clear.html")
```



- The code was based on [[4]](#4)
